title: "Guan Ziwen"

Welcome to my page. I am Ziwen, a student from NUS. I am currently working on a project to develop a data story. As I am a fan of "Lord of the Rings", I will be working on the movies' data content. I have curated some data sources from Kaggle about the movies' achievements and character information. Also, I might have to curate more data by scraping information from the Lord of the Rings Wiki page.
