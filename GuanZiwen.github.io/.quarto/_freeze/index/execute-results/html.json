As I am a fan of \"Lord of the Rings\", I will be working on the movies' data content. I have curated some data sources from Kaggle about the movies' achievements and character information. Also, I might have to curate more data by scraping information from the Lord of the Rings Wiki page.\n\nTo access my GitHub page visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lotr.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
