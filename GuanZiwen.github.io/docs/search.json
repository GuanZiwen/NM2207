As I am a fan of “Lord of the Rings”, I will be working on the movies’ data content. I have curated some data sources from Kaggle about the movies’ achievements and character information. Also, I might have to curate more data by scraping information from the Lord of the Rings Wiki page.\nTo access my GitHub page visit https://GuanZiwen.github.io."
